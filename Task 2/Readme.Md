# Iris Flower Classification Project
üîç Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates a classification task using the famous Iris flower dataset. The goal is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

üß† Steps Covered
Data Import: Load the CSV file containing the dataset.

Data Exploration: Understand the shape, types, and class distribution.

Visualization: Use pairplots and heatmaps to explore relationships between features and species.

Preprocessing:

Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y)

Perform train/test split (80/20)

Standardize the feature values using StandardScaler

Modeling: Train a classifier (e.g., LogisticRegression or RandomForest) using the training data.

Prediction: Make predictions on the test set.

Evaluation:

Use classification_report to assess model performance.

Optionally, display a confusion matrix heatmap.

üì¶ Dependencies
pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

sklearn

torch (if deep learning is included)
